# KenCode - SuperKenVery's Zed fork

This is a community fork of [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed), the rust-based high-performance code editor.

I have a lot of expectations for Zed, so I created this fork and hopefully make what my want happen. However, I tend to have very limited free time, so I really don't know how this will go ;)

## Features

- A new `README.md` that describes this fork. A fresh start!
